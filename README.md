> A simple, yet powerful, client-server communication system built using only UNIX signals. This project, a staple of the 42 School curriculum, demonstrates a fundamental understanding of inter-process communication in a Unix-like environment.

## üåü About The Project

Minitalk is an exercise in minimalist communication. The goal is to transmit a string of characters from a client process to a server process using only two signals: `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`. This project challenges developers to think about data representation, signal handling, and process management in a constrained but powerful way.

The server starts up and proudly displays its Process ID (PID). The client then uses this PID to send a message, bit by bit, with each bit represented by a specific signal. The server listens for these signals, reconstructs the original message, and displays it to the user.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Signal-based Communication:** Utilizes `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` for data transmission.
*   **Client-Server Architecture:** A clear separation of concerns between the message sender and receiver.
*   **PID for Addressing:** The server is identified by its unique Process ID.
*   **Multi-Client Support (Bonus):** The server can handle messages from multiple clients consecutively.
*   **Unicode and Emoji Support (Bonus):** Capable of transmitting a wide range of characters.
*   **Acknowledgement System (Bonus):** The server can send a signal back to the client to confirm message reception.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler (like `gcc`) and `make` installed on your system. This project is designed for a Unix-like environment (Linux or macOS).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/estudiosvizcaino/minitalk.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd minitalk
    ```
3.  Compile the project
    ```sh
    make
    ```
    To compile the bonus version with extra features:
    ```sh
    make bonus
    ```

## USAGE

Using Minitalk is straightforward.

1.  **Start the server:**
    In your terminal, run the server executable. It will print its PID.
    ```sh
    ./server
    ```
    You will see an output like:
    ```
    Server PID: 12345
    ```

2.  **Send a message from the client:**
    In a separate terminal window, run the client executable, providing the server's PID and the message you want to send as arguments.
    ```sh
    ./client 12345 "Hello, Minitalk!"
    ```
    For a message with Unicode characters:
    ```sh
    ./client 12345 "Hello, world! üåçüëã"
    ```

The server terminal will then display the received message.

## üí° How It Works

The magic of Minitalk lies in its use of signals to represent binary data.

1.  **Client-Side:** The client takes the input string and iterates through each character. Each character is converted into its 8-bit binary representation. The client then sends a `SIGUSR1` signal for a '1' bit and a `SIGUSR2` signal for a '0' bit to the server's PID.

2.  **Server-Side:** The server has signal handlers for `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`. When a signal is received, the handler reconstructs the bits into bytes. Once a full byte (8 bits) is received, it is converted back to a character and appended to the message string. After receiving a null terminator character, the server prints the complete message.
